 Project Group 9

This repository contains group 9's code for our math 156 machine learning group project.

See our project_proposal.pdf for more details about our model.

## other folder

This folder contains lots of jupyter notebook files used for testing, but it was not a robust method for version control with many people. Note: not all files run properly in this folder as most were used for our initial testing.

## mountaincar folder

This folder contains the .py files that were used for training the deep Q networks.

Each test that was trained to completion creates a data folder with relevant logs, plots, and model objects.
